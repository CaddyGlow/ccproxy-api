# Remaining Tasks for the v0.2.0 Release

## Blocking Before Tagging
- Finalize version metadata (`ccproxy/core/_version.py:31`, `CHANGELOG.md:8`): regenerate `_version.py` from `setuptools-scm`, update the changelog date, and tag `v0.2.0`.
- Refresh the dependency lock to published builds: `uv.lock` still pins packages uploaded in late 2025 (for example `aiofiles 25.1.0`, `anyio 4.11.0`). Re-lock against current PyPI releases so wheels are available during packaging.
- Resolve MkDocs warnings: `uv run mkdocs build` emits a long list of generated reference pages missing from `nav`. Either include the generated sections or adjust `gen_ref_pages`/`mkdocs.yml` so the release docs build without warnings.

## Important Follow-Ups
- Update installation instructions once artefacts exist (`README.md:155`, `docs/getting-started/installation.md:18`) to point to the published 0.2.0 wheels instead of dev snapshots.
- Confirm no stray backup artefacts are bundled when building sdists/wheels (e.g., `.bak` files, temporary configs).
- Revisit outstanding documentation TODOs that remain unchanged (Docker protocol helper methods, credential balancer README cooldown guidance, plugin scaffold response stub) to decide whether to tackle them now or defer to a maintenance release.
- Review the generated API/reference documentation structure so future contributors know which pages are intentionally excluded versus missing, and capture that decision in `docs/release-v0.2-status.md`.
