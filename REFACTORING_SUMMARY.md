# Claude SDK Service Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored `claude_sdk_service.py` to move all Prometheus metrics recording to `access_logger.py`, following the same pattern as `proxy_service.py`.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Import Updates**
- Added `log_request_access` import from `ccproxy.observability.access_logger`
- Added `RequestContext` import to properly type the context parameter

### 2. **Request Context Enhancement**
- Pass `metrics` instance to `request_context()` for active request tracking
- Pass `RequestContext` to both `_complete_non_streaming()` and `_stream_completion()` methods

### 3. **Removed Direct Metrics Recording**
Removed all direct calls to:
- `metrics.inc_active_requests()` / `metrics.dec_active_requests()` (now handled by request_context)
- `metrics.record_response_time()` (now handled by log_request_access)
- `metrics.record_request()` (now handled by log_request_access)
- `metrics.record_tokens()` (now handled by log_request_access)
- `metrics.record_cost()` (now handled by log_request_access)
- `metrics.record_error()` (now handled by log_request_access)

### 4. **Added Context Metadata Updates**
In both streaming and non-streaming completion methods:
```python
ctx.add_metadata(
    status_code=200,
    tokens_input=tokens_input,
    tokens_output=tokens_output,
    cache_read_tokens=cache_read_tokens,
    cache_write_tokens=cache_write_tokens,
    cost_usd=cost_usd,
)
```

### 5. **Added log_request_access() Calls**
- **Non-streaming**: After extracting metrics and updating context
- **Streaming**: When `ResultMessage` is received with final metrics
- **Error handling**: In the exception handler with error details

### 6. **Method Signature Updates**
Added `ctx: RequestContext | None = None` parameter to:
- `_complete_non_streaming()`
- `_stream_completion()`

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistent Metrics Recording**: All services now use the same pattern for metrics
2. **Single Source of Truth**: `access_logger.py` is the only place that records Prometheus metrics
3. **Cleaner Service Code**: Service focuses on business logic, not metrics recording
4. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundary between data collection and metrics recording
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to metrics recording only need to be made in one place

## No Breaking Changes

- The refactoring is entirely internal
- API behavior remains unchanged
- All metrics continue to be recorded as before
- Only the location of metrics recording has changed

## Testing

Created and ran comprehensive tests that verified:
- Metrics are recorded via `log_request_access()` instead of directly
- RequestContext is properly updated with token and cost data
- Active request tracking still works via request_context
- Both streaming and non-streaming completions work correctly
- No direct metrics recording methods are called anymore
